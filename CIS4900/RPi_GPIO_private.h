Description: this is a library for use with the Raspberry Pi's GPIO controller, intended for use with the University of Guelph's CIS 1500 Fall 13 students

Requirements:
	High Level Functionality 
	Easy to Use (include, library linking)
	Easy to Work With (function calls need to be simple)
	Clean (No crashes, Confirmed results)
	Easy to Read Examples (Enumerated types help with this)
	Compatibility with components on the board for use with the class
	Compatibility with both revisions of the rpi
NOTE: THIS IS A PRIVATE HEADER FILE INCLUDED BY RPi_GPIO.H, YOU SHOULD NOT INCLUDE THIS FILE MANUALLY
